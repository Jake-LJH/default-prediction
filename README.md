Credit cards have changed the way consumers spending ever since, it allows consumers to borrow money for free and pay back in the future, however this could lead to a debt trap which may trigger a domino effect to the economic if not managed well. Despite placing certain criteria for getting a credit card eg: age and income requirement to proof the ability to pay, credit cards providers are still seeing consumers having difficulties repaying until they default. 

A new payment scheme “buy now pay later” (BNPL) allow buyers to defer or spread-out payments for purchases interest-free without the use of credits cards is getting popular since the Covid pandemic, especially among millennial consumers. Some 44 per cent of those aged between 25 and 34 have used a BNPL service — the highest among the age groups polled.

The aim of this project is to bridge the gap of uncertainty through a data-driven approach by using past data of credit card customers in conjunction with machine learning to predict whether a consumer will default on their credit cards.

The goal behind using this model is to achieve two things:
1.	Bring more consistency to the loaning process
2.	Investigate what the key drivers are behind a potential defaulter
